# Next-Word-Predictor

This project is a **Next Word Prediction Model** built using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks in Deep Learning. The model is trained on a text dataset to predict the most likely next word based on input sequences, enabling intelligent text completion and assistance.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

Next word prediction is a key task in natural language processing that enhances text input experience by suggesting the most probable subsequent word. This project uses an LSTM-based recurrent neural network to learn sequential patterns from text data and predict the next word given a sequence of previous words.

The model captures long-term dependencies and context within text, making it suitable for applications like text autocompletion, chatbots, and writing assistants.
